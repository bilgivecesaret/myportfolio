            My name is Uğur Özkan and I have always had a deep interest in software, 
            which eventually led me to become an engineer. 
            My fascination with software development started in high school. 
            I got my first computer in my senior year of high school. 
            At that time, Windows 98 was the operating system. 
            My first coding sessions started with MS-DOS. 
            I got many results with trial and error! 
            Then I started using Microsoft FrontPage and my first web page attempts. 
            While studying Mathematics at Pamukkale University, 
            I took Fortran and C++ programming courses. 
            After graduating from university, I continued my career as a math teacher. 
            After continuing my career as a teacher for a while, 
            I changed my career and continued my career journey as a police officer. 
            During the years I worked as a police officer, 
            I did jobs such as computer setup, software installation, 
            adding resources such as computers, printers, scanners, photocopiers to the network, 
            granting access to resources on the network, 
            monitoring resource usage traffic of users on the network, PDA device setups, 
            network setup, etc. Outside of work, 
            I am an avid traveler and enjoy hiking in national parks and 
            tasting local food in the places I travel to. 
            I am always eager to learn and believe that curiosity is the key to both personal and professional growth.

        <h1>WHO IS UĞUR ÖZKAN ?</h1>
        <p> 
            My name is Uğur Özkan. I have always had a deep interest in software. 
            This interest eventually led me to become an engineer. 
            My fascination with software development began in high school. 
            I bought my first computer in last year of high school. 
            At that time, the operating system was Windows 98. 
            My first coding experience started with MS-DOS. 
            I learned many commands by trial and error. 
            Then I started using Microsoft FrontPage and made my first web page attempts. 
            While studying Mathematics at Pamukkale University, 
            I took Fortran and C++ programming courses. After graduating from university, 
            I continued my career as a math teacher. After continuing my career as a teacher for a while, 
            I changed my career and continued my career journey as a police officer. 
            During the years I worked as a police officer, I did jobs such as computer setup, 
            software installation, adding resources such as computers, printers, scanners, 
            photocopiers to the network, granting access to resources on the network, 
            monitoring resource usage traffic of users on the network, PDA device setups, 
            network setup, etc. Outside of work, I am a passionate traveler. 
            I enjoy hiking in nature and tasting local food in the places I travel to. 
            I am always eager to learn and believe that curiosity is the key to both personal and professional growth.
